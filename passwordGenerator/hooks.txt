notes:--

//In react we use link tag in place of <a> tag because <a> tag reloads the page which is not good for performance.
//link tag don't relods the page and it is faster than <a> tag.
//link tag is used for internal routing and <a> tag is used for external routing.
//in link tag we have (to) as an attribute
// navlink is used for internal routing and additinally it emphasis on single link (like home page in the navbar)
